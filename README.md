# Cryptocurrency Data Analysis and Visualization

This project conducts analysis and visualization of historical price data for Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and XRP using Python. The data is fetched from CoinAPI using an API key and processed to extract valuable insights into the behavior of these digital assets.

## Overview

Cryptocurrency markets are known for their volatility, making them intriguing subjects for analysis. This project aims to provide comprehensive analysis and visualization of historical price data for three major cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP.

## Features

- **Data Extraction**: Utilizes the CoinAPI to fetch historical price data for BTC, ETH, and XRP.
- **Data Cleaning**: Cleans the raw data by removing outliers and handling missing values.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Calculates statistical measures such as mean, median, and standard deviation of returns for each cryptocurrency.
- **Data Visualization**: Generates visualizations including historical price charts and mean return comparisons.

## Usage

1. **API Key**: Obtain an API key from [CoinAPI](https://www.coinapi.io/) and replace the `api_key` variable in the code with your key.
2. **Running the Code**: Execute the `main.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook to run the analysis and visualization.
3. **Interpreting Results**: Review the generated visualizations and analysis output to gain insights into the historical performance of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP.
